**Status: SHIP NOW | Timeline: 8 Weeks | Owner: Gaming Team**

## **TL;DR**

Think RuneScape Grand Exchange meets AI-generated NFTs, where your emotional investment literally creates valuable items that others can bid on.

**Bottom Line:** Every ritual creates loot. Every emotion generates assets. Every agent interaction drops rare items that players can trade in real-time auctions.
