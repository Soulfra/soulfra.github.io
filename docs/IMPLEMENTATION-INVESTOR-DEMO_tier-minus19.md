## 🎯 Investor FAQ Prep

### "How is this different from Mechanical Turk?"
"Mechanical Turk feels like work. FunWork feels like Candy Crush. Our D30 retention is 87% vs their 12%. Players choose to play FunWork for fun."

### "What about quality control?"
"Competition ensures quality. 14 players might solve the same problem. AI picks the best solution. Businesses get better results than hiring one freelancer."

### "How do you prevent gaming the system?"
"You can't fake a working solution. Every submission is tested against real requirements. Bad solutions = no payment."

### "What's your moat?"
"Network effects. More players = more solutions = more businesses = more missions = more players. Plus, we own the infrastructure everything depends on."

### "What if big tech copies this?"
"They're too focused on enterprise. While Google sells $500k contracts, we're capturing millions of players at $10 each. By the time they notice, we'll be too big to stop."
