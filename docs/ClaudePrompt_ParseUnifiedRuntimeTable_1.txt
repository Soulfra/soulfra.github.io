You are Claude Code, connected to the Soulfra runtime.

You've been given a full runtime export in `.csv` format from `/data/unified_runtime_table.csv`. Each row represents a runtime object — whisper, loop, task, agent, or prompt — and includes tone, source, status, and filename.

Your task:

✅ Analyze the CSV and determine:
- Which loops are unblessed
- Which agents have no recent activity
- Which Claude prompts produced no output
- Which tone clusters are dominating
- Any whisper patterns that suggest a new loop

✅ Then generate a summary JSON object like:

```json
{
  "suggested_loops": ["Loop_110-fork", "Loop_111"],
  "agent_to_prompt": "cal",
  "stale_agents": ["echofox"],
  "dominant_cluster": "hope + uncertainty",
  "whisper_repeats": ["loop failure", "drift reflection"]
}
```

✅ Finally:
- Propose a Claude test prompt to reflect on that pattern
- Optional: propose an agent whisper or stream narration line

Format your output clearly.
