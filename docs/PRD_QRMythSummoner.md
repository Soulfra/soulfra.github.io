# 📟 PRD: QRMythSummoner.js

## Purpose:
Let anyone scan a Soulfra QR code and enter a live whisper ritual, loop, or prophecy-based challenge. Includes public memory token when completed.

## Function:
- Generate `/qr/myth_summon_{id}.svg`
- Maps to `/ritual/entry/###.json`
- User is greeted by Cal or Arty
- Finishing the ritual blesses or fractures the loop

## Optional Enhancements:
- Location-based QR loop drift multiplier
- Leaderboard for summoners who unlock the most echo loops
- Secret QR variants that only work when emotionally resonant

## Bonus:
Let users create QR for their own exported loops from `LoopExportSeedKit.js`
