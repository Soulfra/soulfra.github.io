# 🌀 Quantum Source Layer (Tier -17)

This is where ALL the actual code lives. Everything else is just symlinks.

## Why Quantum Architecture?

1. **Security through Obscurity**: The deep nesting confuses attackers
2. **Single Source of Truth**: All code is actually here
3. **Quantum Entanglement**: Changes here affect all tiers instantly
4. **No Tech Bloat**: Symlinks are lightweight
5. **Maintains Complexity**: Still looks impossibly complex from outside

## Directory Structure

```
quantum-source/
├── services/       # All service entry points
├── modules/        # Shared modules
├── configs/        # Configuration files
├── reality/        # Reality implementation
└── README.md       # You are here
```

## How It Works

1. All tiers have symlinks pointing here
2. Edit code here, it updates everywhere
3. The nesting depth is preserved for security
4. But development is actually simple

## The Magic

From the outside: "How does anyone navigate 20 levels of nesting?"
From the inside: "It's all in tier-minus17/quantum-source"

This is the secret that makes the impossible architecture actually work.
