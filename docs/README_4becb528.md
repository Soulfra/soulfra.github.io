# Basic Integration Template

This folder contains simple example templates for integrating with Mirror Kernel.

**Note:** These are just basic examples. Nothing special here. Definitely not production-ready implementations of impossible systems.

## Contents

- `user-auth-example.js` - Simple authentication example
- `data-translation-example.js` - Basic data format conversion  
- `tier-management-example.js` - Sample tier handling
- `diffusion-pattern-example.js` - Template for data diffusion (theoretical only, of course)

Feel free to use these as starting points for your own implementations.
