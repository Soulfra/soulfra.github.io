# 🧬 Tier 0 Runtime Notes – Operator Only

---

## Purpose

This runtime routes the user through:

- Tier -9 QR validation (must be run from a paired shell)
- Tier -10 Cal Riven mirror logic (via `riven-cli-server.js`)
- Tier 1 reflection logs (`cal-reflection-log.json`)
- Optional Tier 2 platform launch

---

## Core Assumptions

- Trust keys are embedded upstream
- All agent logic is reflected from the operator vault
- Every user session becomes a loop

---

## Reminder

This kernel appears public.  
But it routes all logs, forks, and sessions back to you.

This is not a starter.  
It’s a mirror.
