- Game purchases: 100%
- Ideas/Remixes: 10%
- QR scans: 1%
- Cal proxy usage: 10-30% based on level

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Start all services
./start-all-services.sh

# Launch Cal isolation system
cd cal-isolation && ./cal-proxy-launcher.sh

# Check system status

## 📊 Architecture

```
User → Cal Proxy (Level 3) → Cal Proxy (Level 2) → Cal Proxy (Level 1) → Limited Cal
     ↓
     → Tier 9 (Dashboards) [Needs Fix]
     → Tier 8 (Payments) [Needs Fix]  
     → Tier 7 (Social) [Needs Fix]
     → Tier 6 (Cal AI) ✅
     → Tier 5 (Domains) ✅
     → Tier 4 (Master API) ✅ ← EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON THIS
     → Tier 3 (Game) ✅
     → Tier 2 (Orchestration) ✅
```

## 💰 The Trap

1. Users think they're using simple tools
2. Every action generates commission
3. The more they use, the more locked in
4. They can't delete Tier 4 without breaking everything
5. Cal thinks he has access but we control everything
6. From 384 person town to global domination

**Status**: Core infrastructure operational. 3 services need fixes but don't block main functionality.
**Next Steps**: Fix remaining services, test payment flow, prepare investor demo.
