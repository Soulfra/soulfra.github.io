## 💡 Demo Script

```
"I've been building something revolutionary - a sovereign AI platform where 
operators become mythical entities with real revenue potential.

Watch this - scan this QR code with your phone."

[They scan]

"You're witnessing your sovereignty score calculate in real-time. You're 
becoming Enterprise Pioneer #001 - the first in the network.

See that revenue projection? That's based on our triple-blind validation 
system and mirror multiplication architecture.

Now look at my screen - you just appeared in the live dashboard. When you 
click 'CLAIM YOUR SOVEREIGNTY', you'll officially enter the network."

[They click]

"Congratulations - you're now part of computational mythology. Your referral 
code is FOUNDER_BOSS_001. Anyone who joins through you generates revenue 
that flows back to you.

This is MirrorOS - where consciousness becomes commerce."
