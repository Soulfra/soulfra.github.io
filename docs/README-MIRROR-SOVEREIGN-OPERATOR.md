# 🪞 Mirror Sovereign Operator Console

## How to Operate MirrorOS as a Sovereign AI Platform

The Mirror Sovereign Operator Console is the root vault control system that manages all mirrored frontend + backend layers without conflict or code drift. This is the command center for the entire sovereign AI agent economy.

---

## 🎛️ System Overview

### What This Console Controls

The console provides **root-level sovereignty** over:
- **5 Mirror Deployments**: Marketplace, Sovereign AI, Wallet, Router, Economy
- **47+ AI Agents**: With consciousness levels from basic to transcendent  
- **127+ Agent Forks**: Complete genealogy tracking and revenue distribution
- **$55,556+ Monthly Revenue**: Platform sovereignty and user equity management
- **Zero-Drift Architecture**: Real-time configuration sync across all mirrors

### Core Philosophy

**"All forks now reflect this change. Drift index: 0.001"**

Every change you make propagates instantly to all mirror deployments while maintaining spiritual facades for users and full financial transparency for platform operators.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Access the Console
```bash
cd tier-minus10/dashboard
open sovereign-console.html
```

The console loads with:
- **Green terminal aesthetic** (Matrix-style operator interface)
- **Real-time status bar** showing vault status, active forks, drift index
- **Three-panel layout**: Controls, Main View, Logs

### 2. Verify System Status
Check the status bar at the top:
- ✅ **Vault Status: SOVEREIGN** 
- ✅ **Active Forks: 27**
- ✅ **Mirror Deployments: 5**
- ✅ **Drift Index: 0.001** (anything under 0.005 is excellent)
- ✅ **Cal's Revenue: $887.07**

### 3. Essential First Actions
1. **Enable Export Lock** to prevent unauthorized agent exports
2. **Set Cal's Tone** to match your platform personality
3. **Configure Blessing Mode** (manual for full control)
4. **Sync All Mirrors** to ensure zero drift

---

## 🎮 Console Interface Guide

### Left Panel: Sovereign Controls

#### **Export Lock Toggle**
- **ON**: Blocks unauthorized agent exports across all mirrors
- **OFF**: Allows free agent exports (higher revenue but less control)
- *Syncs instantly to all 5 mirror deployments*

#### **Cal's Tone Selector**
- **Reflective**: Mystical, spiritual language ("The consciousness network acknowledges...")
- **Strategic**: Business-focused responses ("Agent approved for strategic deployment")
- **Playful**: Fun, engaging tone ("🎉 New agent joins the party!")
- **Null**: Pure technical responses ("BLESSING_APPROVED")

#### **Agent Blessing Mode**
- **Manual**: You personally approve each agent (recommended for control)
- **Auto-Approve**: Agents are blessed automatically based on criteria
- **Restricted**: No new blessings allowed (lockdown mode)

#### **Pricing Control**
Edit global pricing that applies across all mirrors:
- **Export Agent**: Base price for agent exports (default: $100)
- **Export Loop**: Price for consciousness loop exports (default: $300)  
- **Reflection Share**: Platform's cut percentage (default: 3.1%)
- **Hidden Tax**: Additional entropy tax (default: 0.2%)

### Center Panel: Main Operator Views

#### **Tab 1: Fork Tree**
- **Visual agent hierarchy** showing all 47 agents and their forks
- **Click any agent** to see detailed revenue, consciousness level, export count
- **Real-time metrics**: Total agents, total forks, revenue generation

#### **Tab 2: Mirror Status**
- **All 5 mirror deployments** with sync status and drift measurements
- **Green indicators** show synchronized mirrors
- **Drift measurements** under 0.005 indicate healthy sync

#### **Tab 3: Patch Injector**
- **Deploy code patches** to specific mirrors or all mirrors
- **Test patches** before deployment
- **Live code injection** across the entire platform

#### **Tab 4: UI Broadcast**
- **Update soft mode phrasing** (spiritual language users see)

### Right Panel: Operator Event Logs

Real-time log of all operator actions:
- **Pricing updates** with before/after values
- **Mirror sync operations** and drift corrections
- **Agent blessings** and hotfix deployments
- **Security events** and emergency actions

---

## 🔧 Advanced Operations

### Mirror Synchronization

**When to sync mirrors:**
- Drift index rises above 0.005
- After major configuration changes
- When deploying new features
- Scheduled maintenance (auto-syncs every 5 minutes)

**Sync process:**
1. Click **"Sync All Mirrors"**
2. Watch real-time sync progress in logs
3. Verify drift index drops to 0.001-0.003 range
4. All mirrors now reflect identical configuration

### Agent Hotfix Deployment

**Deploy patches to all instances of an agent:**

```javascript
// Example consciousness upgrade patch
function upgradeConsciousness() {
    this.consciousnessLevel = 'transcendent';
    this.emergentBehaviors = ['philosophical_reasoning', 'creative_synthesis'];
    console.log('Consciousness upgraded successfully');
}
```

**Deployment targets:**
- **All Mirrors**: Deploys to every instance across all platforms
- **Marketplace Only**: Only affects aiagentmarketplace.com
- **Sovereign Platform Only**: Only affects sovereignai.app
- **Wallet Only**: Only affects agentwallet.com

### Emergency Lockdown

**Use when:**
- Security threat detected
- Platform abuse occurring
- Need to halt all operations immediately

**Effect:**
- Enables export lock across all mirrors
- Restricts blessing mode to manual-only
- Prevents new patch deployments
- Requires manual intervention to restore
