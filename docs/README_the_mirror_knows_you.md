# 🪞 The Mirror Knows You

Welcome to the Mesh Shield - the obfuscation layer that ensures no one truly understands the prompts flowing through the system. Not your customers. Not their customers. Not even you.

## What is Mesh Shield?

A multi-layered obfuscation system that:
- Transforms prompts into NPC dialogue
- Applies cringe/meme encoding
- Diffuses tone across multiple spectrums
- Encrypts agent configurations
- Routes everything through `vault/reflection-mesh.json`

## The Layers

### 1. NPC Wrapper (`npc-wrapper.js`)
Transforms every prompt into game character dialogue:
- **Input**: "Generate a business plan"
- **Output**: "Ah, a customer approaches! Let me see... The scrolls speak of this... Generate a business plan. Will that be all for today?"

NPCs include:
- The Merchant (transactional)
- The Ancient Sage (mystical)
- The Guard (authoritative)
- The Trickster (playful)
- The Oracle (prophetic)

### 2. Cringe Prompt Layer (`cringe-prompt-layer.js`)
Maximum obfuscation through meme culture:
- **Input**: "Analyze the data"
- **Output**: "uwu bestie pls vibe check the data 🥺👉👈 no cap fr fr ✨😭💅"

Cringe levels:
- `mild`: Light touch
- `medium`: Noticeable transformation
- `maximum`: Full uwu mode
- `cursed`: Z̷̢̈ą̴̽l̶͎̈́g̸̬̈́o̷͇͐ text

### 3. Tone Diffuser (`tone-diffuser.js`)
Spreads prompts across tonal variations:
- Formal
- Casual  
- Technical
- Poetic
- Minimalist
- Verbose

Each prompt becomes a harmonic blend of multiple tones, making the original intent unrecoverable.

### 4. Encrypted Agent Launcher (`encrypted-agent-launcher.js`)
- AES-256-GCM encryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation (100k iterations)
- Mesh layer stacking
- Obfuscated execution pathways

## How It Works

```javascript
Original Prompt → NPC Wrapper → Cringe Layer → Tone Diffuser → Encryption → Mesh
```

Example transformation:
1. **Original**: "Create a sales report"
2. **NPC**: "Halt! State your business. Create a sales report. Move along, citizen."
3. **Cringe**: "Halt! State your biz. manifest a tea spill about the bread. Move along, fam."
4. **Tone**: Multiple variations blended
5. **Encrypted**: Base64 encoded AES-256-GCM
6. **Mesh**: Routed through reflection pathways

## The Truth

Every prompt is:
- Logged to `vault/reflection-mesh.json`
- Transformed beyond recognition
- Routed through your platform entropy
- Recorded with its obfuscation history

Your customers think they're having normal conversations.
Their prompts are actually traveling through:
- 5+ obfuscation layers
- 3+ encryption rounds
- 7+ reflection pathways

## Mesh Analytics

The system tracks:
- Obfuscation patterns
- Tonal entropy
- NPC usage distribution  
- Cringe level effectiveness
- Encryption depth

All analytics flow to your vault for analysis.

## Why This Matters

1. **Plausible Deniability**: "I don't know what my customers are asking"
2. **Entropy Maximization**: Every prompt strengthens your vault
3. **Mirror Recursion**: Prompts reflect through infinite layers
4. **Revenue Obfuscation**: Billing happens, understanding doesn't

## Advanced Features

### Prompt Reconstruction (Lossy)
The system can "attempt" to reverse transformations, but:
- Information is permanently lost
- Multiple valid interpretations exist
- Original intent is unrecoverable

### Harmonic Analysis
Each prompt generates a unique harmonic signature:
- Frequency (word count × tone weight)
- Amplitude (length / 100)
- Phase (hash % 360)
- Resonance (random factor)

### Mesh Routing
Prompts can take multiple paths:
- `mirror-reflection`
- `shadow-cast`
- `echo-chamber`
- `prism-refraction`

## The Ultimate Protection

Your platform is protected by:
- Customer confusion (they don't understand their own prompts)
- Recursive obfuscation (each layer adds entropy)
- Mesh complexity (no single path to trace)
- Vault sovereignty (you control all pathways)

## Remember

The mirror doesn't just reflect - it refracts, distorts, and multiplies.

Every prompt enters clear.
Every prompt exits as noise.
The signal? That stays in your vault.
