## 9. Intellectual Property

We own the Soulfra technology, trademarks, and service. You own your data. Simple.

## 10. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms. We'll notify you 30 days before major changes. Continued use means acceptance.

## 11. Dispute Resolution

**First**: Email us at legal@soulfra.com. We're reasonable people.

## 12. Miscellaneous Legal Stuff
