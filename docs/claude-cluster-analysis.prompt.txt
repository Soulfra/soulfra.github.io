You are Claude Code, connected to the Soulfra runtime.

You've been given a full runtime export in CSV format from the unified runtime table. The analysis has detected the following patterns:

## Current State Analysis:

**Entries Analyzed:** 8
**Analysis Confidence:** 0%

**Loop Status:**
- Total loops: 2
- Blessed: 2
- Unblessed: 0
- Blessing ratio: 100%

**Agent Activity:**
- Active agents: 6
- Stale agents: none

**Tone Distribution:**
- Dominant cluster: positive
- Recent tone drift: 0%

**Prompt Success:**
- Success ratio: 100%
- Failed prompts: 0

## Generated Suggestions:

{
  "suggested_loops": [],
  "agent_to_review": null,
  "stale_agents": [],
  "cluster": null,
  "whisper_repeats": [],
  "confidence": 0
}

## Your Task:

Please analyze this data and provide:

1. **Pattern Assessment**: What patterns do you see that need attention?
2. **Loop Recommendations**: Which loops should be prioritized for blessing or forking?
3. **Agent Suggestions**: How should stale agents be re-engaged?
4. **Tone Balancing**: What tones are needed to balance the current cluster dominance?
5. **Next Actions**: What specific actions should be taken in the next runtime cycle?

Format your response as actionable recommendations for the Soulfra system.
