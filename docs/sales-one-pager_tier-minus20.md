# SOULFRA - Enterprise Data Protection That's Mathematically Unbreachable

## The $4.45 Million Problem

- **83%** of organizations experienced multiple data breaches in 2023
- **$4.45M** average cost per breach (IBM Security Report)
- **287 days** average time to identify and contain a breach
- **Quantum computers** will break current encryption within 5-10 years

## The Soulfra Solution

### What We Do
Transform your data into mathematical fragments that are impossible to reassemble without biometric authentication - even with infinite computing power.

### How It Works
1. **Fragment** - Data split into meaningless pieces using quantum-resistant math
2. **Distribute** - Pieces stored across multiple secure locations
3. **Protect** - Only authorized biometrics can reassemble

## Why Soulfra Is Different

|---------------------|---------|
| Hope hackers don't get in | Doesn't matter if they do |
| Encrypted data can be broken | Mathematically impossible to break |
