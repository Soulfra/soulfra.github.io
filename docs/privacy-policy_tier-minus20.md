# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: January 2024*

## The Irony Isn't Lost on Us

Yes, we're a privacy company with a privacy policy. Here's the shortest, clearest one you'll ever read.

## What We Collect

### To Run Your Account
- **Email**: So we can send you important stuff
- **Payment Info**: Handled by Stripe (we never see your card number)
- **Device ID**: To ensure only you can access your data

### To Improve Service
- **Usage Metrics**: How much storage, number of API calls (not what you store)
- **Error Logs**: When things break (no personal data included)
- **Feature Usage**: Which features you use (not how you use them)

## What We DON'T Collect

- **Your Protected Data**: We literally can't see it. That's the whole point.
- **Biometric Data**: Stays on your device, never sent to us
- **Browsing History**: We're not creepy
- **Location Data**: Don't know, don't care where you are

## How We Use It

**Your Email**:
- Send you receipts
- Security alerts
- Major service updates
- Nothing else (we hate spam too)

**Usage Data**:
- Keep the service running
- Plan infrastructure capacity
- Fix bugs
- Make Soulfra better

## Who We Share With

**Nobody.** 

Seriously. We don't sell, rent, or trade your information. Ever.

**Exceptions**:
- Stripe sees payment info (they're the processor)
- Law enforcement with a valid warrant (we'll fight unreasonable requests)
- If we're acquired (you'll have 30 days to export and delete your data)

## Your Rights

**Your Protected Data**: 
- Fragmented using our patented process
- Distributed across multiple locations

## Security

We use:
- TLS 1.3 for all connections

## Cookies

**TL;DR**: We collect the absolute minimum needed to run the service. We can't see your protected data (that's the point). We don't sell anything to anyone. You can delete everything anytime. 🔒
