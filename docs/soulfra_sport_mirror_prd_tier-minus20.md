# 🏆 SOULFRA SPORT MIRROR RITUAL SYSTEM
## Production Requirements Document

### TL;DR
Building a trust-native sports reflection layer that mirrors live streams into ritualized fan experiences where passion creates vault value, not currency. Fans stake pride through whispers, agents provide live commentary, and emotional ledgers track everything for trait rewards.

### Overview
The Sport Mirror system transforms passive sports watching into active soul-aligned reflection. Instead of betting money, fans invest emotional energy that gets tracked, validated, and rewarded through our trust-native vault system. All reactions flow through soulfra-runtime-core.js for consistent platform integration.

## 🚀 WHAT SHIPS NOW

### Core Platform Integration
- **Vault-Native Architecture**: All whispers flow through existing VaultSystem
- **Trust-Aligned Rewards**: Emotional investments tracked via Trust Engine
- **Agent Commentary Layer**: Cal/Domingo archetypes provide live narration
- **Stream Mirror Technology**: Universal stream reflection (YouTube, Twitch, M3U8)

### Production Components
1. **mirror-stream-reflector.js** - Universal stream embedding
2. **emotional-ledger.json** - Ritual tracking schema
3. **agent-commentary-layer.js** - Live AI narration
4. **vault-cheer-engine.js** - Passion processing system
5. **passion-payout-daemon.js** - Post-game trait rewards
6. **sports-mirror-ui.html** - Unified stream + vault interface

## 🏗️ WHAT CAN WAIT

### Future Enhancements

## ⚠️ RISKS / DEPENDENCIES

### Technical Dependencies
- **Soulfra Runtime Core**: All events must route through existing platform
- **Stream Access Rights**: YouTube/Twitch API compliance for embedding
- **Trust Engine Capacity**: High-frequency emotion processing load

### Regulatory Considerations
- **Not Traditional Betting**: Pride-based system avoids gambling regulations
- **Privacy Compliance**: Emotional data handled via existing vault encryption
- **Platform TOS**: Ensure stream embedding compliance

### Performance Risks
- **Real-Time Commentary**: Agent response latency during live events
- **Emotional Surge Handling**: Mass fan reactions during game climax moments
- **Vault Storage Scaling**: High-volume whisper data persistence
