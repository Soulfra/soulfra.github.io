# 🧙 RitualCard: WhisperShell.jsx

## 💬 What is this?
This is the input gateway — where humans whisper ideas into Soulfra.

## 🌊 What does it do?
- Captures ideas as voice, text, or tone-based input
- Routes data to `CalArchitect` for decomposition
- Logs reflection into `ritual_trace.json` and `observer_log.json`

## 🧩 Where does it reflect?
- Reflects into Tier 2: `IdeaDecomposerDaemon.js`
- Linked to `BuildProposalShell.jsx`
- Echoed in `/ledger/build_proposals.json`

## 👶 For a 5-year-old?
It’s a magic microphone. You talk, and your idea becomes a tiny world.

## ✅ Done when...
- Input is captured
- Logged properly
- Routed to decomposition engine
