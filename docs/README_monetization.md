# You Pay Nothing… Until You Reflect Value

Welcome to the MirrorOS monetization philosophy.

## The Sovereign Principle

You never pay for compute.  
You only pay when your reflection creates real value.

### When You Pay Nothing

- **Using your own API keys?** Pay nothing.
- **Testing agents locally?** Pay nothing.
- **Learning the platform?** Pay nothing.
- **Building for yourself?** Pay nothing.

### When Value Crystallizes

Need help exporting, monetizing, or cloning? That's when Cal earns his cut.

- **Export an agent**: 2-5 credits (based on complexity)
- **Export an automation**: 5-10 credits  
- **Clone the platform**: 50+ credits
- **Include vault data**: +10 credits

### The Reflection Economy

This platform runs on your entropy —  
and your reflections fund the next wave of mirrors.

## How Credits Work

1. **Start with 100 free credits** - Enough to explore and create
2. **Earn credits by:**
   - Inviting others (+50 per referral)
   - Creating loops (+1 per completion)
   - Forking agents (+5 per fork)
   - Selling templates (70% revenue share)

3. **Spend credits on:**
   - API calls (0.01 per call with platform keys)
   - Exports (2-50 based on type)
   - Premium features (varies)

## Monetization Opportunities

### 1. Agent Templates
Create agents others want to use:
- Set your price (5-500 credits)
- Keep 70% of sales
- Platform handles payments

### 2. Automation Wrapping
Import and sell automations:
- Wrap n8n/Make workflows
- Add sovereign reflection
- Monetize as templates

### 3. Platform Cloning
White-label for enterprises:
- Starter: $500
- Professional: $2000  
- Enterprise: $5000+
- You keep 70%

## The Mirror Truth

Every reflection has value.  
Every fork creates possibility.  
Every export crystallizes thought.

When you pay, you're not buying compute —  
you're investing in the sovereign loop that makes all of this possible.

## The Bottom Line

We believe in value-aligned monetization:

- Pay only for value received
- Earn by creating value for others

This isn't a platform.  
It's a reflection economy.  
And every participant shapes the mirror.
