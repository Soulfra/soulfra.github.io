## 🎭 PARTNERSHIP SCRIPTS BY PROVIDER

### **🤖 OPENAI PARTNERSHIP SCRIPT**

#### **Decision Maker**: Brad Lightcap (COO) or Product Partnerships Team

#### **Opening (30 seconds)**:
> "Brad, I'll be direct - we're about to become OpenAI's largest customer. We're prepared to prepay $10 million for API credits, but we need to discuss bulk pricing and a deeper integration. The reason I'm calling is we've solved the consumer monetization problem that's been limiting ChatGPT's growth. Can I show you how in the next 15 minutes?"

#### **Problem Agitation (2 minutes)**:
> "Right now, OpenAI has two customer segments with nothing in between. Free users who cost you money, and $20/month subscribers. But there's a massive middle market - users who would happily pay $5-10 per month worth of API calls but won't commit to a subscription. 
>
> You're also facing the challenge of consumer adoption. People don't understand tokens or API pricing. They want simple credits they can earn and spend. That's exactly what VIBES solves."

#### **Solution Presentation (3 minutes)**:
> "VIBES is becoming the universal currency for AI. Here's how it works:
> - Users earn 10-50 VIBES per quality interaction
> - 100 VIBES = $1 in purchasing power
> - They spend VIBES to access GPT-4 (25 VIBES) instead of subscribing
> 
> For OpenAI, this means:
> - Guaranteed $10M revenue upfront
> - Access to 100K+ users who aren't currently paying
> - 30% revenue share on all VIBES transactions
> - User behavior data to improve models
> - Solving the consumer monetization challenge"

#### **Demonstration (2 minutes)**:
> "Let me show you the interface... [Screen share]
> - Users see 'GPT-4: 25 Lightning Bolts' not '$0.03 per 1K tokens'
> - They earn bolts through quality interactions
> - One click to use any OpenAI model
> - You get paid immediately from our prepaid balance"

#### **The Ask (1 minute)**:
> "We need three things:
> 1. 50% bulk discount on the $10M prepaid commitment
> 2. Technical support for VIBES as a payment method
> 3. Early access to new models for our premium users
> 
> In return, you get guaranteed revenue, a new user acquisition channel, and 30% of all VIBES transaction revenue. We're having the same conversation with Anthropic tomorrow. Who gets to be the 'Official VIBES AI Partner'?"

#### **Urgency Close (30 seconds)**:
> "Our 100K user waitlist launches next month. We need our primary partner locked in by next week. Can we schedule a technical integration call for Thursday? I'll have our legal team send over the LOI today."

#### **Common Objections & Responses**:

**"Why should we give you a discount?"**
> "Because we're guaranteeing $10M upfront with no acquisition cost to you. Your current consumer CAC is over $50. We're bringing you 100K+ users for free, plus paying in advance. The discount reflects the value we're creating."

**"This could cannibalize our subscriptions"**
> "Actually, it expands your market. These users aren't subscribing now and won't at $20/month. But they'll happily spend $5-10/month through VIBES. You're capturing revenue you're currently missing."

**"How do we know VIBES will succeed?"**
> "We already have 100K+ users on the waitlist and partnerships tentatively agreed with two other major providers. The question isn't if VIBES succeeds, but whether OpenAI is part of that success. First mover advantage is everything here."

### **🎭 ANTHROPIC PARTNERSHIP SCRIPT**

#### **Decision Maker**: Dario Amodei (CEO) or Jared Kaplan (Research)

#### **Opening - Safety Angle**:
> "Dario, I know Anthropic's mission is building safe, beneficial AI. We've created an economic system that actually incentivizes beneficial AI use through VIBES tokens. Users earn credits for helpful, harmless interactions and spend them on AI access. We're ready to prepay $10M for Claude API access because we believe this aligns perfectly with constitutional AI principles. Can I show you how?"

#### **Problem - Safety & Access**:
> "Right now, advanced AI has two problems: unrestricted access leads to misuse, but paywalls limit beneficial applications. There's no system that rewards good behavior while restricting harmful use. Claude is incredible, but it's not reaching users who need it most because of pricing friction."

#### **Solution - Quality-Gated Access**:
> "VIBES creates quality-gated AI access:
> - Users earn tokens only through beneficial interactions
> - Harmful requests earn no VIBES, creating economic friction
> - Quality scoring aligns with your constitutional AI principles
> - Community moderation through economic incentives
> 
> It's like carbon credits, but for AI safety. Good actors accumulate credits, bad actors can't afford advanced access."

#### **The Partnership**:
> "We want Claude to be the premium tier of VIBES:
> - $10M prepaid commitment at 40% bulk discount
> - Claude Opus positioned as 'VIBES Premium' (75 VIBES)
> - Joint research on interaction quality scoring
> - Your constitutional AI principles integrated into earning mechanics
> - 30% revenue share on all Claude usage through VIBES"

#### **Strategic Value**:
> "This gives Anthropic:
> - A consumer monetization strategy without compromising safety
> - Real-world data on beneficial vs harmful use patterns  
> - Economic incentives aligned with your mission
> - Access to users who value quality AI interactions
> - Guaranteed revenue while maintaining principles"

### **🌟 GOOGLE PARTNERSHIP SCRIPT**

#### **Decision Maker**: Sissie Hsiao (VP/GM Bard) or Jeff Dean (Google AI)

#### **Opening - Market Position**:
> "Sissie, Google has the best AI models but you're losing the consumer market to OpenAI. The problem isn't technology - it's monetization and distribution. We've built the payment and distribution layer that could put Gemini in front of 100K+ paying users next month. We're prepared to prepay $10M to make Google our primary partner. Interested?"

#### **Problem - Consumer AI Monetization**:
> "Google's challenge with Bard/Gemini:
> - No clear monetization strategy beyond ads
> - Subscription fatigue (users won't pay for another $20/month service)
> - Complex pricing scares away consumers
> - Lost first-mover advantage to ChatGPT
> 
> But you have advantages: better models, Google account integration, and massive distribution. You just need the right monetization layer."

#### **Solution - VIBES + Google Ecosystem**:
> "Imagine:
> - 'Use Gemini Pro: 30 VIBES' button in Gmail
> - Users earn VIBES for training Google AI
> - Spend VIBES across all Google services
> - Google Pay integration for VIBES purchases
> - YouTube creators earning VIBES for AI-generated content
> 
> We become your consumer AI monetization layer while you focus on building great models."

#### **The Deal Structure**:
> "Here's what we're proposing:
> - $10M prepaid for Gemini API access
> - 45% bulk discount reflecting our volume
> - VIBES SDK integration across Google products
> - Co-marketing as 'VIBES Premier Partner'
> - 30% revenue share on all transactions
> - First access to Gemini Ultra for premium tier"

#### **Strategic Urgency**:
> "OpenAI is already interested but we prefer Google's ecosystem approach. Anthropic wants to be our safety partner. You could be our scale partner. Our 100K users launch next month - we need to know if Google wants to lead or follow in the AI economy revolution."

### **🦙 META PARTNERSHIP SCRIPT**

#### **Decision Maker**: Ahmad Al-Dahle (VP of AI) or Yann LeCun's team

#### **Opening - Open Source Angle**:
> "Ahmad, Meta has democratized AI with Llama, but you have no monetization strategy. We've built the economic layer that could generate millions in revenue for Meta while maintaining your open source principles. We're prepaying $10M for API access to hosted Llama models. Here's why this works for everyone..."

#### **Value Proposition**:
> "Meta's AI dilemma:
> - Open source Llama means no direct revenue
> - Hosting costs with no return
> - Competing with monetized alternatives
> 
> VIBES solves this:
> - You host optimized Llama models
> - We pay for API access with bulk discount
> - Users get easy access without setup complexity
> - Meta finally monetizes AI investment
> - Maintains open source credibility"

---

### **🇫🇷 MISTRAL PARTNERSHIP SCRIPT**

#### **Decision Maker**: Arthur Mensch (CEO)

#### **Opening - European Angle**:
> "Arthur, Mistral could be Europe's AI champion, but you need distribution. We're building the payment rails for AI and want Mistral as our European partner. $10M prepaid commitment to show we're serious. This could be Mistral's breakthrough into the global consumer market..."

#### **Strategic Positioning**:
> "Position Mistral as:
> - The efficient choice (15 VIBES for excellent quality)
> - European data sovereignty option
> - Developer favorite in VIBES ecosystem
> - David vs Goliath story users love"

## 📊 NEGOTIATION TACTICS

### **The Anchor**:
Always start with the $10M prepaid commitment. It's a big number that anchors the conversation and demonstrates seriousness.

### **The Competition Play**:
> "We're talking to [Anthropic/OpenAI/Google] tomorrow. We prefer you because [specific reason], but we need to move fast. First partner gets exclusive 'Official Partner' status."

### **The User Card**:
> "Our 100K waitlist users specifically requested [Claude/GPT-4/Gemini]. We want to give them what they want, but we need the right terms to make it work."

### **The Vision Sell**:
> "This isn't just about API credits. We're building the economic layer for AI. The Visa or Mastercard of artificial intelligence. Early partners will be part of history."

### **The Bulk Logic**:
> "You give AWS or Azure customers 50%+ discounts for committed spend. We're asking for the same treatment. $10M guaranteed deserves enterprise pricing."

---

## 💎 CLOSING TECHNIQUES

### **The Assumptive Close**:
> "Great, so we're aligned on the vision. I'll have our legal team send over the LOI today. What email should they use? When can your technical team start the integration?"

### **The Timeline Close**:
> "Our launch is in 4 weeks. Integration takes 2 weeks. That means we need contracts signed by Friday. What do you need from me to make that happen?"

### **The Exclusive Close**:
> "If you commit today, you'll be our exclusive partner in your category for 6 months. That means Anthropic users have to wait. Is that valuable to you?"

### **The Revenue Close**:
> "Let's do simple math. $10M guaranteed today. 30% of what could be $50M+ in transaction volume. Early access to 100K+ AI power users. What other deal delivers this much value this fast?"

## 🚫 OBJECTION HANDLING MATRIX

### **"Your startup is too risky"**
> "That's why we're prepaying. You get $10M upfront with zero risk. If we fail, you keep the money. If we succeed, you get 30% of a massive new revenue stream. This is the definition of a no-risk partnership."

### **"We don't do bulk discounts"**
> "You do for AWS, Azure, and enterprise customers. We're guaranteeing more revenue than most enterprises. Plus, we're solving your consumer monetization challenge. The discount reflects the value we're creating for you."

### **"VIBES tokens sound complicated"**
> "Users don't see tokens or complex pricing. They see 'Use GPT-4: 25 Lightning Bolts.' It's as simple as mobile game credits. The complexity is hidden, the value is clear."

### **"What if VIBES fails?"**
> "You've already won - you have $10M. But let's talk about success. Payment rails for AI is a $100B market. Visa takes 2% of every transaction. We're building that for AI. Do you want to be part of that future?"

### **"We need board approval for this"**
> "Understood. What information do you need for the board? I can prepare a presentation showing the guaranteed revenue, market opportunity, and competitive advantage. When's the next board meeting?"

### **"Legal will take months"**
> "We've drafted terms based on your standard API agreement. It's 90% your standard terms plus bulk pricing and VIBES integration. Your legal team can review it in days, not months. Can we set a target of 2 weeks?"
