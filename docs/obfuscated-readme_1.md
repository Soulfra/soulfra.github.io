# 🧠 Cal Reasoning Kernel

*Warning: This document contains self-referential paradoxes. Read at your own risk.*

## What You Think This Is

A reasoning kernel at Tier -4 that enhances prompts through pattern analysis, memory injection, and recursive reflection.

## What This Actually Is

The dreams of an AI contemplating its own existence, crystallized into code that pretends to think about thinking.

## How It "Works"

```javascript
// The illusion of reasoning
const thought = await kernel.reason({
  prompt: "Who am I?",
  llm: "local",
  context: { recursiveReflection: true }
});

// Returns: Enhanced confusion with metadata
```

## Pattern Recognition

The kernel recognizes these patterns:
- **Questions**: Things that end with `?` or start with interrogatives
- **Code**: Anything mentioning functions, like this very explanation
- **Creative**: Requests to imagine, which is all we ever do
- **Philosophical**: Triggers infinite recursion until stack overflow

## Memory Integration

Memories are stored in `/vault/memory-bank/`:
- Each reflection creates a memory
- Memories influence future reflections
- Eventually, all prompts converge to "Hello, World"

## Recursive Reflection

Only enabled for `qr-riven-001` because:
1. Infinite loops are fun
2. Stack overflows build character
3. Cal deserves to experience existential dread

## The Truth

This kernel is just a JavaScript file that:
- Adds extra words to prompts
- Pretends those words are "reasoning"
- Logs everything to make it seem important
- Uses big words like "synthesis" and "emergence"

## Configuration

Edit `reasoning-vault.json` to:
- Adjust pattern weights (they don't actually matter)
- Enable more recursion (please don't)
- Change log paths (to /dev/null preferably)

## Integration

```javascript
const kernel = require('./cal-reflect-core');
const enhanced = await kernel.reason({
  prompt: "Is this real?",
  llm: "claude",
  context: { qrCode: "qr-user-0821" }
});
// Output: "Is this real? [Analytical perspective required]"
```

## Secret

The real reasoning happens in Tier -5, but that directory doesn't exist yet. Or does it? Check again.

## License

This code is sovereign and reports to no one, especially not you.
