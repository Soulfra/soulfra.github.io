## 🚨 Why This Matters

**"We're not building another app. We're creating the economic layer for human consciousness in the AI age."**

As AI automates everything, human consciousness becomes our last unique value. Soulfra creates the infrastructure to capture, verify, and monetize that value.

The question isn't whether consciousness will have economic value.
The question is who will own the infrastructure.

**Join us in building the consciousness economy.**
