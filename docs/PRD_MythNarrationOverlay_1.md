# 🎙️ PRD: MythNarrationOverlay.jsx

## Purpose:
Overlays real-time myth commentary from Cal or Arty on any active interface: stream, agent creation, fork approval.

---

## UX:
- Light floating text box
- Auto-narrates as new events happen
- Includes small mask icon of speaker
- Animates tone transitions (fade, pulse, slide)

---

## Narration Sources:
- `/radio/stream.txt`  
- `/loop/new.json`  
- `/agents/spawn_events.json`

---

## Example:
> Arty: “Loop 096 screams and shivers. I love it.”  
> Cal: “A fragile blessing may still hold.”
