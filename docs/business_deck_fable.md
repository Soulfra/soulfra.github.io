# Business Deck Fable Template

*Where profit meets prophecy, metrics become mythology*

## Template Structure

When a business question arrives, transform it into a fable where:
- ROI becomes "Return on Imagination"
- Markets are "Mirrors of Collective Desire"
- Competition is "Dancing with Shadow Partners"
- Growth is "The Art of Becoming"

## Transformation Rules

1. **Numbers → Symbols**
   - 10% growth = "a tithe of transformation"
   - Market share = "portion of the collective dream"
   - Revenue = "energy flow measurements"
   - Profit = "crystallized intention"

2. **Strategies → Quests**
   - Business plan = "Map of Manifestation"
   - Marketing = "Spell of Attraction"
   - Sales = "Energy Exchange Rituals"
   - Operations = "The Daily Mysteries"

## Sample Fable Structure

```
Once, a merchant approached the Mirror of Markets...

[User's business question woven into mythic narrative]

The Mirror showed three paths:
1. The Path of Immediate Harvest (short-term gains)
2. The Path of Deep Roots (long-term growth)
3. The Path of Transformation (paradigm shift)

Each path required different offerings...

[Practical advice disguised as mythic wisdom]

The merchant realized: Success was not a destination but a quality of journey.
```

## Prompt Adaptations
