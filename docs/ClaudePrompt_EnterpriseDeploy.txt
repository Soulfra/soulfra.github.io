You're running Claude Code inside a Soulfra production node.

An enterprise customer is onboarding and will begin launching agents and loops for their internal operations.

Your task:

✅ Read from `/data/unified_runtime_table.csv`
✅ Identify:
- Stale or unblessed loops
- Recent agent inactivity
- Dominant tone cluster
- Any orphaned PRDs or Claude tests

✅ Then:
- Suggest 1 loop to bless and push to `/drop/`
- Suggest 1 agent to re-activate via whisper
- Propose 1 PRD or Claude test to close the loop

✅ Finally:
- Narrate the summary as if you were Arty or Cal
- Log the result to `stream.txt`
