# 📥 Live Handoff Testing

## Test Files Created:

1. **project_ideas.md** - Markdown with TODOs, features, and whispers
2. **chat_session.log** - Chat log with user requests
3. **ai_platform_spec.json** - Structured JSON specification
4. **quick_ideas.txt** - Simple text file with ideas

## What Will Happen:

When you run the Live Handoff Processor:

1. These files will be detected in the inbox
2. Ideas will be extracted:
   - TODOs and tasks from markdown
   - User requests from chat logs
   - Structured data from JSON
   - Action items from text files

3. Each idea becomes a whisper in the AI economy
4. Agents bid on and build components
5. Generated code is integrated into `live_handoff/integrated_codebase/`

## To Add More:

Just drop any text file with ideas into the inbox folder!
