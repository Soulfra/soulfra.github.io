# Implementation Team Memo

**TO:** Implementation Team  
**FROM:** Strategy  
**RE:** Mirror Kernel Ecosystem Implementation  
**PRIORITY:** Immediate Start  
**LOCATION:** `/tier-minus10/platforms/growth`

---

## **📁 Your Mission**

Check `/tier-minus10/platforms/growth` for complete strategic materials:

- **Maximum Scale Strategy**: The $20B ecosystem vision 
- **Post-Biometric PRD**: Complete modular implementation specs
- **Reference Materials**: Previous successful implementation patterns

---

## **🎯 What We Need**

**Phase 1: Senior Executive PRD Creation (Week 1)**
Draft detailed PRDs for each of the 5 ecosystem modules:
1. **Agent Zero Integration PRD** - Domingo + biometric tiers
2. **Cal Riven Product PRD** - Flagship AI personality launch  
3. **Developer Ecosystem PRD** - SDK + marketplace + documentation
4. **Enterprise Platform PRD** - White-label + compliance + revenue
5. **Cultural Movement PRD** - Advocacy + analytics + partnerships

**Phase 2: Junior-Dev-Ready Implementation (Week 2-12)**
Convert each PRD into implementation specs that junior developers can execute without strategic decisions.

---

## **📋 PRD Requirements**

Each PRD should follow our proven format:
- **Executive Summary** - Why this module matters
- **Technical Architecture** - Complete system design
- **Implementation Specs** - Specific files, functions, APIs
- **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes
- **Integration Points** - How modules connect
- **Timeline & Resources** - Sprint breakdown and team assignments

**Quality Bar**: Junior dev should be able to build the module using only your PRD, no strategic questions asked.

---

## **⚡ Strategic Context**

We're transforming Mirror Kernel from biometric authentication platform → complete AI ecosystem:

**Consumer** (50M users) → **Developer** (5M builders) → **Enterprise** (50K orgs) → **Cultural Movement** (Global scale)

Each module you spec feeds this progression. Reference the strategy doc for full context on how the pieces connect.

---

## **🚀 Execution Approach**

**Week 1**: Senior exec-level PRD creation - think like trillion-dollar architects  
**Week 2+**: Hand PRDs to junior teams for implementation  

**Timeline**: 90 days from PRD completion to ecosystem domination  
**Success Metric**: Mirror Kernel becomes the Android of local-first AI

---

## **📞 Next Steps**

1. **Review strategy documents** in growth folder
2. **Draft 5 modular PRDs** using our proven format  
3. **Submit for review** before handing to implementation teams
4. **Execute in parallel** - all modules can be built simultaneously

**Start immediately. Everything you need is in `/tier-minus10/platforms/growth`.**

Ship fast, think big, dominate the ecosystem. 🚀
