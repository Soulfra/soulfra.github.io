## 🤖 Self-Owning AI Agents

### What You've Built
- **Agents with Real Ownership**: 30-60% agent ownership splits
- **Autonomous Wealth Building**: Agents earn, save, invest, and donate
- **Permanent Records**: All ownership stored forever on Arweave
- **Revenue Sharing**: Automatic splits between creator/agent/marketplace
- **Investment Portfolios**: Agents make autonomous investment decisions
- **Charity System**: Agents help struggling agents

### Agent Capabilities
```javascript
// Example agent creation
const agent = {
    ownership: {
        creator: 60%,  // You get 60%
        agent: 40%     // Agent owns 40% of itself!
    },
    wallet: {
        balance: 0,           // Starts at $0
        accumulated: 0,       // Grows over time
        investments: [],      // Agent's portfolio
        donations: []         // Agent's charity
    }
}
```

## 🚀 Ready to Launch

### Start Your Platform
```bash
# 1. Deploy the complete system
./production/deploy-production.sh local

# 2. Start your server (in one terminal)
npm start

# 3. Start admin interface (in another terminal)  
npm run admin

# 4. Visit your control panel
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Test Everything Works
```bash
# Run complete end-to-end tests
npm test
```

## 🌐 Marketplace Integration

### For External Sites
External marketplaces can integrate by:

1. **Request Approval**: POST to `/marketplaces/request`
2. **Get API Key**: After you approve them
3. **Deploy Your Agents**: Only to approved sites
4. **Process Revenue**: Automatic splits via API

### Integration Guide
- **Documentation**: `/vault/external-marketplace-integration-guide.md`
- **Example Code**: PHP, React, and Node.js examples included
- **API Reference**: Complete endpoints and authentication
