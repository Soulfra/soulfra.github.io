## WHAT WENT WRONG

The "Ultimate Arena" and "Drag & Drop Character Creator" were too complex:
- Image processing doesn't actually work in browser
- Too many features = too many places to break
- Complex UI = more chances for things to not display

## WHAT WORKS NOW

I created SIMPLER versions that ACTUALLY WORK:
- Port 6666: Simple arena game (no abilities, just shoot)
- Port 6969: Character selector (no image upload, just click to pick)

These games have:
- ✅ No formatting errors
- ✅ No complex features that break
- ✅ Actual working gameplay
- ✅ Simple controls that work
