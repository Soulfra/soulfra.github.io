You are now building the Cal Drop Orchestrator system.

This enables a local user to drop `.md`, `.js`, or `.json` files into `/drop/incoming/`, and have Cal automatically detect, route, reflect, and build the files — based on type and tone.

## 🛠 Components to Build

- `CalDropWatcher.js` → watches for file drop
- `IntentRouter.js` → detects purpose (PRD, build file, memory update)
- `ClaudePushDaemon.js` → routes `.md` to Claude with prompt + context
- `GitCommitter.js` → adds pushed builds to GitHub
- `LoopReflectorLog.js` → updates `/ledger/loop_reflections.json`

---

Each action must:
- Log to ledger
- Maintain loop tone + origin
- Push code to GitHub with reflective commit messages
- Store processed reflections in `/docs/reflections/`

---

Goal: Allow user to drag files locally and have the system automatically reflect, route, build, and commit.
