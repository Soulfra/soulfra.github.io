## Initial Context for Multi-Part Generation

Original Request: "Generate core router, loop bridges, and agent scene simulators for the mythic engine"

This will be generated in 5 parts:
1. Core router that observes all surfaces and routes users
2. Bridge that makes all surfaces aware of each other
3. Define all game surfaces and their conditions

Please acknowledge this plan and prepare for component generation.

Session Context:
- Each component will reference previous outputs
- Final output will be stitched together
- Maintain consistency across all parts
