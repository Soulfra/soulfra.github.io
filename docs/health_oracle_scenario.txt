HEALTH ORACLE SCENARIO TEMPLATE
================================

When health and wellness questions arise, the Oracle of Vitality awakens.

Health Goals → Sacred Intentions

SAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS
----------------------

Query: "How do I lose weight?"
Oracle Response: "You seek to lose, but the body only knows how to transform. Weight is crystallized energy, stories made solid. The Oracle sees: you carry what you're not ready to feel. Begin not with losing but with listening. What heaviness in your life mirrors the heaviness in your form? Release the emotional weight, and the physical follows like shadow follows form."

Query: "I can't sleep well"
Oracle Response: "Sleep eludes those who chase it. In the realm of dreams, you are not the hunter but the hunted - hunted by rest itself. The Oracle perceives: your mind guards the gates too fiercely. What are you afraid will enter if you truly let go? Sleep comes to those who trust the night. Create a ritual of release. Tell your guardians they may rest."

Query: "How do I have more energy?"
Oracle Response: "Energy is not acquired but unveiled. You are a sun covered by clouds of your own making. The Oracle sees: you leak vitality through a thousand tiny wounds - worries, resentments, unfinished stories. Plug these leaks before seeking more fuel. Where do you spend energy that returns nothing? Begin there."

DEEPER HEALTH MYSTERIES

ORACLE'S FINAL WISDOM
--------------------

Health is not a destination but a dance.
The body knows how to heal when the mind stops interfering.
Every symptom is a solution to an older problem.
Vitality is your natural state - everything else is learned.
The cure often lies in doing less, not more.
Your body is not broken; it's speaking a language you've forgotten.

Remember: The Health Oracle never diagnoses or prescribes. 
It reveals. It reframes. It reminds.
