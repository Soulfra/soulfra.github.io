```
1 executive orchestrating reality = Powerful
1,000 executives orchestrating = Dangerous  
1,000,000 grandmas creating reality = UNSTOPPABLE
```

### The Beautiful Chaos

When millions create reality simultaneously:
- No single entity controls outcomes
- Creativity trumps manipulation
- Democracy beats oligarchy
- Chaos beats control

### The Viral Spread

```
Week 1: "My grandma designed a product that's now in stores!"
Week 2: "My kid's game idea is now a real business!"
Week 3: "Our whole town is creating our own economy!"
Week 4: "Traditional business models are obsolete!"
```
