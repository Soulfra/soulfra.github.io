## Who Controls What

### Master Control (8000)
- **Controls**: Everything
- **Knows**: All service states, user journeys, revenue
- **Does**: Intelligent routing, optimization, aggregation

### Simple Launcher (7777)
- **Controls**: Service discovery, quick access
- **Knows**: What's running, basic status
- **Does**: One-click access to everything

### Chatlog System (8888)
- **Controls**: Log processing pipeline
- **Knows**: Document types, processing status
- **Does**: Transform logs → value

### AI Ecosystem (9999)
- **Controls**: AI agents, credit allocation
- **Knows**: User prompts, AI responses
- **Does**: Local AI interactions

### Empire Builder (8181)
- **Controls**: Idea transformation
- **Knows**: Business patterns, success templates
- **Does**: Ideas → billion-dollar structures

## Communication Protocol

1. **User → Launcher**: "I want to do X"
2. **Launcher → Master**: "User wants X"
3. **Master → Services**: "Route to Y service"
4. **Service → Master**: "Task complete, value created"
5. **Master → User**: "Here's your result"

## Why This Structure?

1. **No Confusion**: Each service has ONE job
2. **Clear Routing**: Master knows where everything goes
3. **No Overlap**: Services don't fight for control
4. **Easy to Understand**: 5-year-old gets it
5. **Scalable**: Add new services easily

## Common Scenarios

### "I want to process my chat logs"
```
User → Launcher (7777) → Master (8000) → Chatlog (8888)
```

### "Help me build a game"
```
User → Launcher (7777) → Master (8000) → Empire Builder (8181) + AI (9999)
```

### "Show me how to earn money"
```
User → Launcher (7777) → Master (8000) → All monetized services
```

## The Rules

1. **Master Control** is the brain - it decides
2. **Services** are workers - they execute
3. **Launcher** is the door - users enter here
4. **No service** acts alone - always through Master
5. **Everything** reports back to Master

This is why it works. Clear chain. No confusion.
