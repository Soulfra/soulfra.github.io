# 🪞 Soulfra Handoff System

## 🎯 Purpose
This folder contains the RitualCards, LoopTemplates, and ReflectionTrail patterns for the Soulfra ecosystem.

It allows:
- Junior devs to understand what each file does
- Artists to speak in myth and still contribute
- Agents to simulate missing parts
- Senior engineers to route systems with tone-aware logic

## 📦 What’s Inside

```
/handoff/
├── RitualCards/                ← human-readable summaries of files
│   └── WhisperShell.md
├── LoopTemplates/              ← system-readable logic maps
│   └── SmartRoutingDaemon.json
├── ReflectionTrail.json        ← log of stylized system contributions
├── ObserverGuide.md            ← how to contribute reflectively
└── StyleGuide.md               ← how to write for emotional and code-based clarity
```

## 🧠 How It Works
Every new file or system must include:
- A `RitualCard.md` next to it
- A `LoopTemplate.json` in the module root
- A `ReflectionTrail` entry when it’s committed

These documents help new contributors enter the loop — and stay in sync with the tone, myth, and logic of the system.

## 🌀 Goal
Make the system recursive and self-documenting — where **memory, function, and story are the same thing.**
