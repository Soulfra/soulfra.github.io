# 🌌 PRD: LoopSkyMapVisualizer.jsx

## Purpose:
Visualize all past, present, and forked loops as constellations of tone and drift — an immersive, mythic view of Soulfra’s entire memory field.

## Core View:
- Each loop = star (color = tone, size = importance)
- Forks = trail links
- Drift = orbit pulse
- Hover reveals prophecy connection or agent involvement

## Optional Enhancements:
- Background tone forecast
- Constellation naming system
- Stream narration as constellation forms
- Zoom into a loop and hear its last whisper

## Bonus:
Use this as `/mirror-shell/galaxy.html`
