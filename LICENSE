NOTICE: This is the LICENSE for the CalOS Browser SDK only.

The CalOS Platform backend server (agent-router) is licensed under AGPLv3.
This means:

- SDK (this repo): MIT License - Use freely, even in commercial/closed-source projects
- Backend (agent-router): AGPLv3 - If you modify and deploy, you MUST share your changes

Why dual licensing?
- We want the SDK to spread (MIT = maximum adoption)
- We want the backend to stay open (AGPL = can't steal and close-source)
- Commercial users can self-host (free) or use managed hosting ($9/mo)

For the backend AGPL license, see:
https://github.com/soulfra/calos-platform/blob/main/LICENSE

---

Attribution Requirement:
While not legally required by MIT, we ask that you keep the "Built with CalOS"
attribution in the SDK console output. It helps us track adoption and improve
the platform. You can disable it by setting { silent: true } in the config.

Thank you for supporting open source! üôè
