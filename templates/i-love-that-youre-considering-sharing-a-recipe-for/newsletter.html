<p><em>This guide is based on insights from howtocookathome.</em></p>

<p>I love that you're considering sharing a recipe for salted butter with your audience! To get started, let's break down the basics of how much salt to use and why. Generally, a good starting point is about 1-2% salt by weight. For example, if you're using 100g of unsalted butter, you'd want to add around 1-2g of flaky sea salt or kosher salt. However, the type of salt you choose can affect the flavor profile, so feel free to experiment with different options.</p>

<p>To make things more accessible for your readers, I'd recommend creating a simple recipe card that outlines the basic ingredients and proportions. You could also include some suggestions for variations, like using different types of salt or adding a pinch of sugar to balance out the flavors. Don't forget to include clear instructions on how to churn or whip the butter until it reaches the desired consistency.</p>
