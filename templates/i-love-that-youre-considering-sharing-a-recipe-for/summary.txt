# how do i make salted butter?

I love that you're considering sharing a recipe for salted butter with your audience! To get started, let's break down the basics of how much salt to use and why. Generally, a good starting point is about 1-2% salt by weight. For example, if you're using 100g of unsalted butter, you'd want to add around 1-2g of flaky sea salt or kosher salt. However, the type of salt you choose can affect the flavor profile, so feel free to experiment with different options.

To make things more accessible for your readers, I'd recommend creating a simple recipe card that outlines the basic ingredients and proportions. You could also include some suggestions for variations, like using different types of salt or adding a pinch of sugar to balance out the flavors. Don't forget to include clear instructions on how to churn or whip the butter until it reaches the desired consistency.
